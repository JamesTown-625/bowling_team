Knowing that you are a budding programmer, your friends have asked you to create a scoring program for your Saturday bowling league. They want the program to work as follows:

- At the end of each game, the program asks you to record the scores for each team member. You type in their first name and that person's score for the game on a single line separated by a single space i.e. John 280

- When there are no more players to input, enter an empty line.

- Your program should now print the following lists in columns:
    1. the names and scores of each bowler in the order entered
    2. the names and scores in descending order with high scorer at the top
    3. the names and scores in alphabetical order

- If anyone scores a perfect game, put an asterisk in front of their name.

- Next, your program should display the following summary information:
    1. Display a congratulatory message showing the high score and who got it.
    2. Display a sympathetic message showing the low score and who got it.
    3. The team average score, rounded down to the nearest pin.

- Last, your program should write each of the lists and the summary information
to a text file called game_results.txt in the same format it is displayed on the screen.

Your program should work with the following input:

Sam 200
\nBill 125
\nMary 235
\nJane 205
\nAlex 300
\nSue 280
